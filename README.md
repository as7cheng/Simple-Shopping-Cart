Introduction

We are going to implement a shopping cart that represents a collection of market items. This cart will be represented by an array. In this application, we assume the following:
1.The cart stores a collection of items of type String (descriptions for market items),
2.Each market item is identified by an index (unique number)
3.The shopping cart may contain multiple occurrences of the same item,
4.Users can ask how many occurrences of a given item are in the shopping cart (may be 0 or more)
5.Users can remove an item from the shopping cart,
6.Users can checkout the shopping cart (i.e. display number of items in the shopping cart together with total cost), 
7.Users can display the content of the shopping cart.

We note also that the market product catalog (set of products available for sale in the market) and the shopping cart (set of items selected by the user for purchase) are stored in two different places.
